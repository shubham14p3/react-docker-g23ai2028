- React v18.3.1
- Vite v5.3.4
- Github

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, cd to the directory where you would like the repo to live by typing on your terminal:

```
$ cd <directory>
```

# Clone the repo typing:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:shubham14p3/react-docker-g23ai2028.git
```

# Step 1: Install the needed package:

```
$ npm i
```

# Step 2: Build the Docker Image

```
$ docker build -t react-docker-g23ai2028 .

```

# Step 3: Check Docker images

```
$ docker images
```
# Step 4: Run the Docker Container

```
$ docker run -p 5173:5173 react-docker-g23ai2028
```

Finally, docker is ready on the port 5173:

```
Open below link in your browser.
Local:   http://localhost:5173/
Network: http://172.17.0.2:5173/
```

## Extra Knowledge: Setting up Docker in local

Create new file Dockerfile and place the below code

```
# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
FROM node:20-alpine

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json .

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 5173

# Define the command to run the app
CMD [ "npm","run","dev" ]
```
Create new file `.dockerignore` to ignore larger file from the Image similar to .gitignore
